# People, Places, Time, Money: Listing *Robinson Crusoe*

As we have noticed, in *The Rise of the Novel*, Ian Watt argues that, like the jury in a court of law, the readers of a novel expect

>to know 'all the particulars' of a given case - the _time_ and _place_ of the occurrence; both must be satisfied as to the _identities_ of the parties concerned, and will refuse to accept evidence about anyone called Sir Toby Belch or Mr. Badman -- still less about a Chloe who has no surname and is 'common as the air'...". (31, emphasis added)

Though we may quarrel with many of Watt's implicit and explicit claims (including the confidence with which he refers to a thing called a "novel"),  our reading of *Robinson Crusoe* so far has likely convinced us that specific times, places, and names - as well as amounts of money and dates -- seem important, though we will differ as to our interpretation of precisely *how* they are important.

This exercise helps us extend our thinking about the fictional representation of places, characters' names, times and dates, and money by using a tool called the [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml) to extract references to time, location, organization, person, money, percent, and date from the text of *Robinson Crusoe*.  In short, we are going to reduce the amazingly weird and complex *Robinson Crusoe* to a list,  extracting just some data in order to create a deliberately impoverished representation of it - one that leaves out most of the novel to let us look more closely and comprehensively at a very specific part of it.

After extracting these lists, we will try our hand at interpreting them. How is reading these lists different from or similar to reading *Robinson Crusoe* in a more continuous way, from beginning to end or cover to cover?

We also want to think about the lists of food, animals, tools, physical characteristics, and events we have found IN *Robinson Crusoe* - what is their function?  Moving from literary criticism to named entity extraction and text manipulation and back again to literary criticism should open up this question further.

In short, in this assignment we will

1. use the Stanford NER to classify some of the words in *Robinson Crusoe* as Time, Location, Organization, Person, Money, Percent, or Date.
2. convert the NER output into into seven separate lists.
3. do some close reading of and thinking about one or more of those lists.

(Note: in Exercise 2 we will build on this work by using some additional tools and techniques to help us visualize some of the data and interpret it in new ways - and you are welcome to begin doing this right away by yourself if you have the time and inclination. Right now, however, we are sticking with what we can learn by creating and reading plain old lists.)

Here are very detailed, step-by-step instructions. If you prefer, you are free to skip the instructions, try to figure out how to do it yourself, and skip to the "Read and Think" section.

**NOTE: The Stanford NER can be clunky, and since we can't have a lab this week, I highly recommend that - unless yo are the kind of person who enjoys fiddling with software - that you SKIP the actual running of the NER and move straight on to the "Manipulate and Clean Your Data" section below, using the output file in our Week 2 folder instead of generating the output yourself.***

## Using the Stanford NER on *Robinson Crusoe*

The procedure you need to follow will differ depending on whether you're using a Mac or PC.

Not getting the expected results? Scroll down to "Troubleshooting."

### Mac instructions

Before you begin if you do not have Java installed on your machine, install it :https://www.java.com/en/
 If you don't want to install Java, that's fine; skip the NER step and use the raw NER output in Dropbox Week 2 to proceed to the "Clean and Manipulate Your Data" step.

1.Download and unzip the [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml#Download), then open the file named "ner-gui.command".
   + You may get the following error message: "'ner-gui.command can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." You can get around this by control-clicking on the file and clicking "Open."
2. The NER program should open in two windows: in your Terminal and in a Java application window. In the second window, erase the pre-loaded text and click File -> Open File in the menu to open the clean Project Gutenberg version of *Crusoe* you will find in the "Assignment Materials" folder in this repository and in our Dropbox "Exercise Supplementary Materials" folder. (We will talk more about how we create and find usable machine-readable text files of our novels in future assignments, and you will learn to create them yourself.)
3. In the NER menu bar, click "Classifier" and choose "Load CRF from file." Navigate to where you have installed the NER and find the "Classifiers" folder. Select the file with 7 entities that ends in gz (full name "english.muc.7class.distsim.crf.ser.gz"). The seven entities (or categories the NER reads for) will appear on the right side of the window.
4. Click the "Run NER" button then WAIT. It is likely that nothing will happen for the first few seconds, but clicking the button again will cause the NER to run twice, giving you duplicate results.
5. Eventually, the text of RC will appear in the window with the relevant words tagged in the various entity colors. Interesting! But not very easy to use.
6. Luckily, a more flexible form of the tagged entities awaits you in your Terminal. Click over to the Terminal now, and use Command-A and then Command-C to copy the entire list.
7. Download, install, and open [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html), a text editor that will help you process your results. (If you are familiar with regular expressions and have a text editor you prefer, you are welcome to use it.) Create a new file, paste the full list into it, and name it in some regular, identifiable way (for example, "RCNER.txt" or "RCList.txt"). There will probably be a few lines of text generated by Terminal at the top of the page, before the NER results begin; feel free to delete this.


### PC instructions for installing and running Stanford NER

These instructions are adapted from ["Running the Stanford NER on Windows,"](http://imgur.com/a/yCPJx) by Rise of the Novel 2015 student Claudia Lo, with updates from Rise of the Novel 2018 student Miguel Gonzalez.

Before you begin if you do not have Java installed on your machine, install it. If you don't want to install Java, that's fine; skip the NER step and use the raw NER output in Drpbox Week 2 to proceed to the "Clean and Manipulate Your Data" step.

1. Download the [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml#Download) zip file and extract the folder inside it.
2. Shift + right click somewhere inside the folder and click "Open Powershell Window here" in the menu that pops up. Type the following and hit enter:
> ner-gui.bat
3. You should now see a Java application window with some pre-loaded text. Erase the preloaded text, then copy the contents of the "RC_Gutenberg_clean.txt" file from the "Assignment Materials" or from the copy in our Dropbox "Exercises" folder in this repository and paste it in.  (We will talk more about how we create and find usable machine-readable text files of our novels in future assignments, and you will learn to create them yourself.)
4. In the NER menu bar, click "Classifier" and choose "Load CRF from file." Navigate to where you have installed the NER and find the "Classifiers" folder. Select the file with 7 entities that ends in gz (full name "english.muc.7class.distsim.crf.ser.gz"). The seven entities (or categories the NER reads for) will appear on the right side of the window.
5. Click the "Run NER" button then WAIT. It is likely that nothing will happen for the first few seconds, but clicking the button again will cause the NER to run twice, giving you duplicate results.
6. Eventually, the text of RC will appear in the window with the relevant words tagged in the various entity colors. Interesting! But not very easy to use.
7. Luckily, a more flexible form of the tagged entities awaits you in your command window. Click over to the command window now, and use Command-A and then Control-C to copy the entire list.
8. Download, install, and open [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.1.html), a text editor that will help you process your results. Create a new file, paste the full list into it, and name it in some regular, identifiable way (for example, "RCNER.txt" or "RCList.txt"). Create a new file, paste the full list into it, and name it in some regular, identifiable way (for example, "RCNER.txt" or "RCList.txt"). There will probably be a few lines of text generated by Terminal at the top of the page, before the NER results begin; feel free to delete this.


### Troubleshooting

**If the NER won't open or only opens a Terminal window**: the most likely issue is that your computer is running an older version of Java. There are several ways to check your computer's Java version:
+ Click through to [this link](https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp) (unfortunately, this won't work on Google Chrome).
+ OR: on a Mac, open your System Preferences and click the Java icon; on a PC, launch the Windows Start menu, then click through Programs -> Java -> About Java.
+ OR: type "java -version" in the command line.

As of 10/16/16, the current version of the NER needs Java 1.8 or later. If you have an earlier version installed, you can either update Java or download an [earlier version](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml#History) of the NER (version 3.4.1 and earlier support Java 6 and 7).

If the NER still won't load, try installing [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html). *Double-check first to make sure you don't already have Java JRE installed; if you accidentally install it a second time, you may need to uninstall and reinstall Java to get it to work again.* Version 8u101 should be sufficient. Choose either one of the Mac OS X versions or Windows x64, depending on your operating system.

**If the NER still won't open, or if you receive an error message along the lines of “Could not reserve enough space for 1536000KB object heap"**: make sure you have the command line open, with the Stanford NER folder set as your working directory. If you're following the PC instructions, this should already be the case. If you're using a Mac, find a program called Terminal in your Utilities folder and open it. Then use the "cd" command to navigate to the folder where the NER is installed. If the folder is on your desktop, for example, the command might look something like this:

> cd Desktop/stanford-ner-2015-12-09

Once you've navigated to the appropriate folder, try opening the NER by entering the following into the command line:

> java -Xms64m -Xmx256m -jar stanford-ner.jar

**For other issues,** refer to the very complete instructions in Michelle Moravic's [How to Use the Stanford NER and Get Results](http://historyinthecity.blogspot.com/2014/06/how-to-use-stanfords-ner-and-extract.html) or ["Using the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer to extract data from texts"](http://themacroscope.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/textanalysisandviz.html) in the preprint version of *The Historian's Macroscope*.

**If you are still stuck, ask a classmate who has done the exercise successfully or move on to the NER raw output file in our Week 2 folder.**

## Manipulate and Clean Your Data

Great, you have a long list of tagged terms. Now you want to make seven separate lists. This will not take long.

### Mac instructions

1. Download, install, and open [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html), a text editor that will help you process your results. (If you are familiar with regular expressions and have a text editor you prefer, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), you are welcome to use it.) Create a new file, paste the full list into it, and name it in some regular, identifiable way (for example, "RCNER.txt" or "RCList.txt"). There will probably be a few lines of text generated by Terminal at the top of the page, before the NER results begin; feel free to delete this.

2. Keep the file with your NER results open in BBEdit.

3. Under the "Text" menu, select "Process Lines Containing" and enter PERSON. Make sure you check the boxes for "Case sensitive" and "Copy to new document." Click "Process".

4. You should now have a new file containing only the "PERSON" lines. Save it with an easily legible, regular name (like "RCNER_persons.txt"). Now scroll through, taking a look at the names. What did you expect? What do you see? What are you learning already?

5. You will see that there are many duplicates, and also perhaps some errors - errors that may be generated by either bad input data (misspellings or mis-transcriptions in the Project Gutenberg file, for example) or errors generated by the NER (places misrecognized as names, for example). Right now we don't need to worry about errors - but if you see some that occur regularly you might want to think about why this happened.

6. To de-duplicate in order to create a list with only one instance of every occurrence, under the "Text" menu, select "Process Duplicate Lines." Make sure "Leaving one" and "Unique lines to new document" are checked. Save your new document with a legible, regular name.

7. Repeat for the six other types of extracted entities.

### PC instructions

These instructions are adapted from ["Running the Stanford NER on Windows,"](http://imgur.com/a/yCPJx) by Rise of the Novel 2015 student Claudia Lo.

1. Download Notepad++. (If you are familiar with regular expressions and have a text editor you prefer, you are welcome to use it.)

2. Keep the file with your NER results open in Notepad++.

3. Under the "Search" menu, select "Find". In the window that opens, select the tab for "Mark." Next to "Find what :", enter
> PERSON:

then make sure the boxes for "Bookmark line" and "Match case" are also checked. Click "Mark All."

4. If you close the Find window and scroll through your text file, you should see that all lines including dates are now highlighted. Now, under the "Search" menu, click Bookmark > Copy Bookmarked Lines. Open a new file and paste the lines in. You should now have a new file containing only the "PERSON" lines. Save the file with an easily legible, regular name (like "RCNER_persons.txt"). Now scroll through, taking a look at the names. What did you expect? What do you see? What are you learning already?

5. You will see that there are many duplicates, and also perhaps some errors - errors that may be generated by either bad input data (misspellings or mis-transcriptions in the Project Gutenberg file, for example) or errors generated by the NER (places misrecognized as names, for example). Right now we don't need to worry about errors - but if you see some that occur regularly you might want to think about why this happened.

6. To de-duplicate in order to create a list with only one instance of every occurrence, you'll need to install a plugin for Notepad++. Go to Plugins > Show Plugin Manager, then click "Available" and scroll down to TextFX Characters. Check the box, install it, and restart Notepad++ when it prompts you.

7. You should now have an extra menu item called "TextFX". Select all of your text (CTRL-A), then go to TextFX > TextFX Tools, and make sure both "+ Sort Ascending" and "+ Sort outputs only UNIQUE (at column) lines" are checked. Then, pick the "Sort lines case insensitive (at column)" option from the same menu.

8. You should now have a deduplicated version of the PERSONS list. Save this as a separate file with a legible, regular name.

8. Go back to your original file with the full NER list. Go to Search > Bookmark > Clear all bookmarks.

10. Repeat steps 1-8 for the six other types of extracted entities.

### Wrap-up

Take a look at the deduplicated documents; think about their length as compared to the length of the original document. What does this tell you?

In another sense, we could say that though we have removed the literal duplicates, in another sense "duplicates" remain in the form of multiple different words or phrases referring to the same character or place, for example. What can you learn about the language and logic of *Robinson Crusoe* from these?

Extra and optional, just for fun: Depending on what else you might want to do with your data in the future, you may want to clean or manipulate it in other ways. For more sophisticated comparison between lists, save one or more of your lists with a .csv instead of a .txt ending, download [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) and watch the short introductory videos to learn how you can quickly count occurrences, identify and condense similar names, etc.

As always, remember to create a new, clearly and regularly-labeled copy of your data every time you work with it in a new way.

## Read and Think

So now you have extracted seven lists from your novel. Starting with two questions at the back of your mind - What can we learn from these lists about *Robinson Crusoe*? What can we learn from *Robinson Crusoe* about lists? -  slowly read one or more of your lists.

In a basic sense - did the NER work? In the case of any given list, did it work as you expected? Which of your assumptions about *Robinson Crusoe* are reinforced by your reading of the list(s)? Which assumptions or readings were challenged or denaturalized?

## Write

Write a **single paragraph** or so in which you succinctly describe the most interesting things you have discovered through your work and thought -  and perhaps speculate on questions your work with these lists has opened up and how you might answer them. You can do this however you like. Suggestions to get you started: You might return to a passage from the novel and read it alongside a list or an aspect of a list; you might compare one of your lists to a literal list from RC; you might speculate on how one of these lists helps you reread some aspect of RC, or confirms or challenges some aspect of your thinking about the novel.  You might simply spend some time unwinding your reading of one of the lists. You might spend a paragraph interpreting a comparison of an original and a de-duplicated list.

No matter what you do, be specific and precise; quote examples; show us that you are worrying away at the texts. Feel free to speculate wildly, but make sure your speculation is hooked to specific observations, readings, interpretations.

## Post

Post your paragraph to Wordpress. Give it a title that makes in clear what assignment it is.

## Extra (not at all required, any of these are just for fun)!

1. What is a list? What kind of form is it? How do lists work in *Robinson Crusoe*? Is there a history of the list? Can you find an academic history of the list? A popular history of the list? How many lists have you encountered today? Ordered or unordered, digital or analog, short or long?

What kind of order do the lists we created have? How might that order have meaning? Or what would we need to know or do to access that meaning?

2. How does the Stanford NER work? Do a bit of research and write a quick explanatory post.

3. In ["Mapping Mutable Genres"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3323), Ted Underwood, Loretta Auvil, and Boris Capitanu discover a correlation between "first-person" narration, travel, and quantification.

>first-person pronouns are positively correlated with terms that describe travel—and especially travel by sea. We found one clue to this association when we looked at a list of titles sorted by our classifier. A remarkable number of the works recognized as most strongly “first-person” in character belonged to the genre of the Robinsonade. We were aware that *Robinson Crusoe* (1719) was a widely-reprinted and frequently-imitated novel, but we hadn’t realized just how long and vigorously this tradition endured. *The Swiss Family Robinson* (1812) was joined by an *English Family Robinson* (1852), for instance, and eventually by a *Robinson Crusoe of the Nineteenth Century* (1884), and many others. The castaway premise obviously encourages a story to rely on first-person narration, and we suspect it may also encourage quantification. Crusoe’s obsession with enumeration and accumulation is famously part of the colonial logic of his narrative, which transforms (ostensibly) uninhabited land into a well-governed productive system. ("Mapping Mutable Genres," Section 2C)

They hypothesize that the reason may be that the castaway premise, or "the combination of a first-person narrator, a colonial setting, and acquisitive quantification" in adventure fiction may encourage both first-person narration and quantification. Based on your work examining the NER outputs of Time, Money, Percent, and Date, can you offer any hypotheses of your own based just on *Robinson Crusoe*? If you wanted to extend what you've learned from the NER data about languages of quantification in RC, what further information would you need? What other correlations within RC might you look for? If you wanted to extend your investigation outward to the Robinsonade, or to adventure or travel fiction more broadly, how might you go about doing that?

4. Help create the next iteration of Rise computational assignments! In the next update of this assigment, I will probably move on from using the Stanford NER took to using the Python library spAcy; [here's an example of an assignment that uses spaCy](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/12-Named-Entity-Recognition.html). If you are someone who is interested in this, try playing with the NER tools in spaCY and write a post describing the experience. Another approach to this would be to seek out some web-based tools for running the NER and experimenting to see what they would be like to use in an assignment like this one.
